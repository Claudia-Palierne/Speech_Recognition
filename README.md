Speech Recognition Final Project READM
# Project Description

In an era where voice-activated virtual assistants and speech-based applications are becoming
increasingly prevalent, the field of speech recognition classification has taken center stage. As
data scientists, we find ourselves at the forefront of this fascinating domain, tasked with
deciphering the intricacies of voice data and enabling machines to understand human speech
patterns. Our objective in this project is to explore the realm of speech recognition classification,
specifically focusing on the recognition of basic commands. We developed a system capable
of accurately identifying and classifying a predefined set of commands, including categories
such as 'yes', 'no', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine', 'up', and 'down'.
